# SentimentAnalysisOnCovid19Tweets
Analyzed user data from twitter to predict the sentiment from the text, improving accuracy to 80.5%.

AI Algorithm Used: NLTK/NLP, CNN, FCNN and kNN, Naïve Bayes, Keras, TF/IDF and Word2Vec

## Abstract
In today’s fast transforming world filled with technology twitter has become the voice of every individual’s opinion with regards to daily occurring activities. We are trying to predict the polarity [positive, negative] of every opinion posted by classifying the sentiment scores which are computed by TextBlob that are given in the file according to a numerical range [+1,-1].This sentiment analysis helps to understand public behaviour. In this range, tweets with a sentiment score of -1, were classified to be negative, 0 to be neutral and lastly +1 to be positive, eliminating all the neutral opinions. Our main objective of this project is to explore the psychology and behaviour of these texts and determine this polarity of tweets that are posted related to COVID-19 using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Models. The data-set has been formulated using publicly available IEEEDataPort–“Coronavirus (Covid-19) Tweets Dataset- corona-tweets-01.csv”. We have approached our goal in 2 folds, where firstly we have implemented NLP data preprocessing using tfidf and word-to-vec techniques. Upon which we have implemented SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, LSTM, CNN and Dense neural networks. We have outperformed the base model by doing hyper-parameter tuning on the model – achieving an accuracy of 80.5%.
